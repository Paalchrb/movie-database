# movie-database
Remake of the movie database from Javascript 2019 bootcamp with Golang

Following is the task description:


## Checkpoint Week 8
Use what you've learned this week to create a full stack JavaScript application as described below.



### The application is a movie collector / archiver with the following functionality (required):
- You should be able to add movies to your archive with the following information:
    - The title of the movie
    - A movie poster (image)
    - The year of release
    - A plot synopsis (summary)
    - The main genre of the movie (drama, thriller, action, etc)
    - Your rating of the movie from 1 to 5 stars
    - The running time of the movie (in minutes)
- You should be able to se an overview of all your movies
- You should be able to select a movie and view the details of it
- You should be able to edit the details of the movie (f.ex change the rating)
- You should be able to delete a movie from your archive
 
 
You can use IMDb as a source for demo data.




### Use the following technologies/techniques (that we've been working with this week):
- node.js
- express
- postgres
- fetch
- Template function (for creating markup)
- Rendering functions (to render the views)
- Event handlers (to add behavior to the views)
 

 
 
 
### Additional things to have in mind:
- Error handling
- Validation
- Loading indicators

 
 

### Bonus features (and stretches):
- Make it look nice!
- Can you make it possible for a movie to have multiple genres? (Hint: Postgres array types)
- Can you make it possible to sort the movies by title, release year and rating in the overview? (Hint: Add buttons as  triggers and look at ORDER BY in postgres)
